CUSP Book Draft:

•	To enable sharing of personal data and experiences,
we need secure technology and regulation that allow individuals to safely and conveniently share personal information with each other, with corporations, and with government. Consequently, the heart of the New Deal on Data must be to provide both regulatory standards and _nancial incentives that entice owners to share data, while at the same time serving the interests of both individuals and society at large. We must promote greater idea ow among individuals, not just corporations or government departments.
•	It has long been recognized that the _rst step to promoting liquidity in land and commodity
markets is to guarantee ownership rights so that people can safely buy and sell. Similarly, the
_rst step toward creating greater idea and idea ow (`idea liquidity) is to de_ne ownership rights.
The only politically viable course is to give individual citizens rights over data that are about
them and in fact, in the European Union these rights ow directly from the constitution. We
need to recognize personal data as a valuable asset of the individual that is given to companies
and government in return for services.
•	Data collectors thus play a role akin to a bank, managing the data on behalf of their customers.
•	CONTRACT OF ADHESION: You have the right to full control over the use of your data. The terms of use must be opt-
in and clearly explained in plain language. If you are not happy with the way a company
uses your data, you can remove the data, just as you would close your account with a bank
•	that is not providing satisfactory service.
•	CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCING: Individual rights to personal data must be balanced with the need of corporations and govern-
ments to use certain data-account activity, billing information, and so on-to run their day-to-day
•	operations.
•	2012 Consumer Data Bill of Rights in the United States, along with a matching declaration on Personal Data Rights in the EU.
•	RESOURCE: The World Economic Forum (WEF) has dubbed personal data as the \New Oil" or resource of the 21st century
•	MISC: End-user centricity: All entities in the ecosystem need to recognize that end-users are
vital and independent stakeholders in the co-creation and value exchange of services and
•	experiences.
•	TRUST LAW When a trust network involves use of personal data, then the user permissions and corresponding limits on use are fundamental to the trust model.
•	CONTRACT OF ADHESION End User License Agreements
•	(EULAs), long incomprehensible texts have been accepted blindly by the end-user, trusting they
•	have not agreed to anything that could harm them.
•	REGULATORY LAW/INSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS: There are four categories of institutional controls: governmental controls; proprietary
•	controls; enforcement tools; and informational devices."
•	CON LAW: A key element for aligning stakeholder interests
•	and realising the vision of the personal
•	data ecosystem is the concept of end usercentricity.
•	This is a holistic approach that
•	recognises that end users are vital and independent
•	stakeholders in the co-creation and
•	value exchange of services and experiences.
•	A construct designed for the information
•	economy, it breaks from the industrial-age
•	model of the “consumer” – where relationships
•	are captured, developed and owned.
 
DATA AS A NEW ASSET:
•	As some put it, personal data will be the new “oil” – a valuable
resource of the 21st century. It will emerge as a new asset class touching all aspects of
•	society.
•	Transparency: Individuals expect to know
what data is being captured about them,
the manner in which such data is captured
or inferred, the uses it will be put to and the parties that have access to it;
•	DOES NOT EXIST IN LAW: Trust: Individuals’ confidence that the
attributes of availability, reliability, integrity
and security are embraced in the
applications, systems and providers that
have access to their personal data;
• Control: The ability of individuals to
effectively manage the extent to which
their personal data is shared;
• Value: Individuals’ understanding of the
value created by the use of their data and
the way in which they are compensated
•	for it.
•	INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND NORMS: Define global principles for using and
•	sharing personal data.
•	Not in the law: Innovate around user-centricity and trust.
•	RAW MATERIAL: data is becoming a new
type of raw material that’s on par with capital
and labour.
•	(e.g.,
personal data systems related to banking
have different purposes and applicable laws
than those developed for the telecom and
healthcare sectors).
•	COOP: The personal data ecosystem will be built
on the trust and control individuals have in
sharing their data. From a technological,
policy and sociological sense all stakeholders
need to embrace this construct.
One particular area of focus is the continued
testing and promoting of “trust frameworks”
that explore innovative approaches
for identity assurance at Internet scale.
•	“ECOSYSTEM” terminology: some predators and some prey
•	COOP? CONSORTIA? NOT IN THE LAW: Continually share knowledge. It’s a
•	huge challenge for entities to keep up
•	with new research, policies and commercial
•	developments.
•	Personal data ownership: The concept of
property rights is not easily extended to
data, creating challenges in establishing
•	usage rights;
•	Individuals
do not “own” their criminal records or
credit history. Medical providers are required
to keep certain records about patients,
•	TRANSPARENCY: for many organisations,
it often poses a risk to their business
model. When customers suddenly find out
how their trusted brand of product or service
was gathering and using their personal
data, they tend to react with outrage, rather
than reward the business for its transparency.
Similarly, citizens fear Big Brother control
and manipulation in the way government
uses their personal information. As long
as the risk of transparency outweighs the
rewards, the personal data ecosystem will remain
vulnerable to periodic seismic shocks.
•	International law, western hegemony:
Uncertainty and tension also exist around the
evolution of personal data exchanges and the
degree of political empowerment they could
create. Some governments can perceive
empowered citizens as a disruptive threat to
their agenda. Understanding the concept of
user-centricity in the context of differing social,
•	cultural and political norms is clearly needed.
•	Corporate law? Shareholders? The key to unlocking the full potential of
data lies in creating equilibrium among the
various stakeholders influencing the personal
data ecosystem.
•	NOT LAW, COOPERATION: Over time, all stakeholders should hopefully
recognise that the collective metric
of success is the overall growth of the
ecosystem rather than the success of one
•	specific participant
•	NOOO An expanded role for government, such
that governments can use their purchasing
power to help shape commercially
available products and solutions that the
private sector can then leverage
•	trust is another key ingredient
required for creating value from today’s
oceans of disparate personal data.
