 * In response, I suggest that the understanding of property as a bundle of interests rather than despotic dominion over a thing helps frame a viable system of rights with respect to personal data. Moreover, these property interests are to be shaped through legal attention to five areas: inalienabilities, defaults, a right of exit, damages, and institutions. A key element of this model is the employment of use-transferability restrictions in conjunction with an opt-in default. This Article calls this model “hybrid inalienability” because it allows individuals to share, as well as to place limitations on, the future use of their personal information. The proposed hybrid inalienability follows personal information through downstream transfers and limits the negative effects that result from “one-shot” permission to all personal data trade.
