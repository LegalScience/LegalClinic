# Cam Kerry Summary of Current State of Privacy and Future Implications

* Precedent, including FIPPs
* FCC enforcement actions against Google, Facebook, et al
* Europeans have a more rights-based and prescriptive system. Privacy is a fundamental right under European declaration of rights and lisbon treaty. All data processing and collection must have a legal basis. In the US, by contrast, common law process of data gathering. 
* Obama administration blueprint on privacy -- 2012 -- we need to set a baseline of rights based on a consumer privacy bill of rights. based on FIPPs, but updated for the volume, velocity, and variety that exists today. This remained in play as of last year, CKerry had drafted legislation that'd put the bill of rights into effect, make it directly enforceable by the FTC regardless of whether a company had a privacy policy of any kind. we need that so that businesses have a clear roadmap, so that customers and individuals have a clear set of expectations and understandings about how their data is used. 
* Need to empower individuals more. There is currently an asymmetrical marketplace. market should do more to protect privacy because companies have a stake in sustaining their brands and sustaining the ecology of the internet. concern: outlaws and outliers, and other things that can undermine trust.
* Obama, et al believe we are "one big incident" away from an erosion of trust and significant increase in demand for cybersecurity.
* President has asked to set up a task force to look at the questions of big data and get its arms around where things are headed and to what extent additional protections and measures are needed. 
* RFI questions about data: policy implications of collection and storage, the ways that the collection creates benefits and risks, and the legal implications for the existing regime. What are the implications for international norms and governance of the internet?
* Impact of Snowden: great for economic impact; trust of US companies internationally. Eroding confidence in the existing system of internet governance. 

## Legal issues on the table
* Move forward with legislation: enact the privacy bill of rights to balance the marketplace and empower individuals. 
* Legal science and tech can implement principles of the privacy bill of rights through tech
* Lesson of big data: must move away from simple, notice and consent regime, to one that gives more force to other principles included in FIPPs and privacy bill of rights. This includes:
* Respect for Context: the use of the data should be consistent with the context in which the data was provided (includes the nature of the relationship between customer and vendor, etc)
* Tech solutions: Use of privacy metadata to help validate that privacy protections are being observed. 
* ID^3: Rules-baesd mechanisms to understand what privacy rules apply based on location. If you have a cellular customer in Europe, where different rules apply depending on jurisdiction -- need to correlate with location information to help ensure compliance. 

* Motivating question at medialab: How can technology put into practice the consumer privacy bill of rights?
* Legal paradigms: Miller case and third party doctrine. Now that we share information with a range of third party providers, old paradigms no longer work. 
* President Obama's discussion of ยง215 collection by NSA suggest that president has a different view of this type of collection. 
* Data discussions in Europe are moving forward
