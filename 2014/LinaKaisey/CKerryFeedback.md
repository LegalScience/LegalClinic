# New deal on data presumes its our data, but is it? Consider:
* IP law; 3rd party doctrine; notions of confidentiality and trust
* there's a sliding scale, contextual, depends on data subject and type of data
* Touchstone standard: FIPS. Starting point for privacy bill of rights, privacy directive 95, and a lot of best practices 
* Survey of current: state of privacy law (FIPS, G-B, HIPPA,FIPS still don't address "whose data is it?" -- HIPPAA provides for access, Fair Credit Reporting Act also gives access. But doesn't address the property rights question. if talking about data as a na sset class, there's an ambiguity in Sandy's idea. not clear if it's a corporate asset -- corps treat it that way. Sandy is saying it's a personal asset. 
* Trust law. Classic bundle of rights: trust law severs legal ownership (title) from beneficial ownership 
* Law can apply and imply a constructive trust; provides a potential answer to the different contexts of data privacy and data ownership. depends on nature of data and consequences. Interests of data holder/collector/processor. 
* Third party doctrine: in current environment, it can't be taken to its logical extension. law enforcement happily extends it farther. ECPA reform. DOJ wants to be able to say "anything you give to google is fair game." No expectation of privacy if google can read your emails to advertise to you. They gave up on that. Can't have a rule that says outlook account is protected but gmail is not. There's plenty of our info that's in hands of third parties that courts would say we have expectation of privacy of. things that have been transactional records -- phone records bank records that are kept for business purposes -- do those now require warrant? 
* when third party gets it? depending on TOS? when third party performs some analysis on the data?
* Smith v. Maryland; U.S. v. Miller - phone and bank records, respectively. Call records existed apart from customer accounts. Makes it more ambiguous as to whether records or personal data.
* when the property interest in information changes as a result of the content being changed (in parody cases, etc)
* compulsory license
