**Three-Part Framework for Data Privacy** 

* Note: This paper is being developed as part of the MIT Human Dynamics Lab [Clinical Legal Research Project](https://github.com/LegalScience/LegalClinic/blob/master/2014/LinaKaisey/ClinicalInternshipPlan.md)

# 1. Introduction and Underlying Principles

## a. Social Physics Perspective

### i. Trust Networks

* Combination of contract law and computer science principles

* Individuals have different “rings” (exchange networks) for different facets of life

### ii.Analogue between information as we might conceive it, and money as we currently conceive it:

* Money: Given to a bank until individual wishes to withdraw it. Bank retains general/aggregate info even after money is withdrawn, but bank does not retain money. Individual knows where money goes and who holds it.

* Same with entities holding your information: retain only aggregate information; individual can decide to sever ties and withdraw individual information 

### iii Davos standards

* Provenance

* Permissions

* Auditable 

* Do not track

## b. Background and context

### i. Anchoring Privacy Legal Issues to Big Data Scenarios


Scenario Description Method:

1. Components of scenario[d]

## **Actors?**
(ie: Who are the parties, their respective roles and relationships?  Who is data owner?  Who is using the data? Who are the data subjects?)
## **Interactions?**
(ie: What transactions or other exchanges between Actors?)
##**Data?**
(ie: What kind of personal data?  What is type of big data models, analytics or other outputs result from this scenario? What’s the Data Lifecycle?[j] What constraints apply:  e.g. Retention, liability for breach, and accuracy?)
## **Systems?**
(ie What business, legal, technical or social system matter most?)
   * Business Systems (Ethics committees, sign-off by authorized officers, record keeping, audit) 
   * Legal Systems (Contracts, Employee rules/procedures, certification/accreditations, compliance reviews, insurance/bonding requirements, industry standard policy/guidelines, etc) 
   * Technical Systems (System permissions and security, alarms & automated detection of PAI, automatic anonymization of data, cryptography, etc) 
   * Social Systems (What social systems and context exists?)


## 2. Analysis of scenario


* Goals (ie: What are the incentives and the benefits driving the Actors? who benefits? what are financial incentives?)
* Rules: (ie: What are the relevant laws and regulations, other enforceable rules)
* Risks: What are the risks? To whom? If the risk is an externality, how might it be mitigated?[o][p][q][r][s][t]


## 3. Assessment of scenario


### Existing or related best practices for context of this scenario

   * What business, legal and/or technical best practices 

### Gap
   * Issues Not Addressed by Existing Practices and Solutions
   * Short Fall Between Current and Needed Practices and Solutions

**Track generally to the anchoring scenarios used by [MIT Big Data Privacy WG](https://github.com/LegalScience/BigDataPrivacy/blob/master/BigDataPrivacyWG.md)**


**Instructions:**
Use the elements (context, practice and gap) in the privacy impact assessment above to create a structured assessment of the scenario you are working on. The objective is to produce something analogous to an abstract for a conference paper or the executive summary for a board paper. Check that each section for the assessment of a scenario has attempted to address each of the questions or examples in the sub bullets of the elements.

* Scenario 2:

### ii. Current Best Practices and Standards Related to the Issues

* Anonymize and Aggregate,
* ETC
* Promsing Legal Reforms, eg: FIDUCIARY ACCESS TO DIGITAL ASSETS ACT

# 2. Government Collection of Data: Metadata on the Metadata

## a. NSA or other government agency must ask specifically for the information it wants

## b. If data is stored in multiple stores across multiple jurisdictions, need acquiescence in each jurisdiction in order to access all the stores, and therefore, all the data.

## c. Based on the quantity and nature of queries, can point out unusual variance in government’s requests

## d. Mechanism:

i. Governmental Regulation creates the requirement for devolved repositories of data

ii. The data may be held by private entities (perhaps with oversight to ensure vigilant guarding  of the data)



# 3. Corporate Collection of Data: ClearButton

## a. Government regulations afford individuals the right to access information about themselves

i. Current examples: medical records, credit records

## b. The same right will attach to knowledge about what information corporations have about individuals

## c. Mechanism:

i. Government regulation creates the requirement for corporations to disclose information to the ClearButton registry  

ii. Individuals sign up for ClearButton in a similar fashion to the “do not call” registry  

iii. Individuals receive periodic emails once new information about them is being stored  

iv. Individuals click on a link to be taken to the ClearButton notifications center, which in turn contains links to the sites of corporations that have data about the individual



# 4. Individual use of data: Personal Data Stores

##a. Individual keeps all the data that the government or a corp has about them in a PDS.

## b. Benefits: 

i. Increased transparency – each individual knows what information the government/corporation has about them

ii. Decreased paperwork – individuals can auto-fill documents with information in their PDS that has already been certified

iii. Value add for users – aggregated data is used to improve services

## c. Mechanism: 

i. Individuals put information into the PDS

ii. Data is shared with the government/corporation in an aggregated, anonymous way

iii. Government/corporation uses data to add value for businesses


## d. Public Trust Company Framework

# 5. An Integrated Privacy Legal Framework

[Describe how this the parts comprise a holistic, sustainable well adapted system]
