CFK, DG comments:

* consumer contract and warranty clause issues that come up in consumer context. Courts willingness to apply contract terms.

* Wellsian fairness notions in the privacy context. Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. MA law and other jurisdictions on contracts. Even non-adhesive contracts.  Most implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing are in business hiring practice

* generally give context on the areas and apply them to the Big Data context 

* Griswold and penumbras -- not that there are penumbral rights, but that people don't think in terms of particular constitutional interests (eg associational interests, etc) but penumbras of 1st 4th 9th (6th?) amendments give rise to associational, expressional, etc issues. Eg 5th self-incrimination

* clusters of scenarios: consumer; national surveillance; genomics. Individuals have roles within those clusters (eg patient informed consent; buyer and seller). Follow a set of data around the internet and see how it implicates various types of rights, like IP rights and then constitutional rights, etc

Much has been said about the necessity of a legal framework surrounding Big Data, yet there is no clear introduction for non-lawyers to think about the legal assumptions that will underlie such a framework. This paper fills that gap by laying out the tenets of three sets of legal rights that might serve as the foundation for a right in personal data. First, a property-based conception of rights puts data in the purview of the individual, meaning that an individual may bargain away those rights as she sees fit. Second, a “civil rights”-based conception of rights assumes that the individual’s right to data privacy is too fundamental for society to allow it to be bargained away. Finally, an interests-based notion recognizes that an individual’s interest in their data, while purely individual in theory, has pragmatic effects on society such that society must place its hand in the market that regulates the vindication of the right.

The framework underlying a Big Data society will include the interaction of Legal, Business, and Technical solutions. This paper does not directly address the Business and Technical facets. Within the legal frameworks underlying Big Data society, there are also multiple actors: common law principles, constitutional norms, regulatory bodies, international treaties, individual enforcement mechanisms, and other such mainstays of legal systems will all play relevant parts. This paper seeks to highlight those elements that will—and in some cases already have—translated to the realm of issues surrounding the use of personal data.

# Property Rights

A property-based framework of rights assumes that an individual’s interest in her personal data is the same as in any other thing that she may own. Property rights in the legal field are conceived of as a “bundle of rights” – depending on the nature of the property owned and the context of the ownership, an individual may expect a certain mix of rights. So, individuals’ rights in their personal data depend on how we conceive of personal data as property. 

## Contracts of adhesion
It is useful to compare the current state of contract terms to the legal concept of a “contract of adhesion.” Otherwise known as “boilerplate contracts,” these contracts have terms that are determined by the more powerful party and largely or entirely non-negotiable. Examples of contracts of adhesion can include contracts for insurance or for the rental of property. Courts sometimes find such contracts “unconscionable” and therefore unenforceable, when the terms of the boilerplate exceed what a customer may reasonably expect.

## Alienability and Inalienability
Property law tends to assume that society is best served when the restrictions on the trade of property are as few as possible. As a result, one of the largest sticks in the bundle of property rights is the right to alienability: the ability for an individual to trade away her interest in property whenever she sees fit, rather than when society allows her to do so. This aspect of property rights gives concern to data privacy advocates who believe that it will make it too easy for individuals to give away access to their personal data. However, there are ways to mitigate this concern. The first and simplest is to recognize that courts have recognized that some property rights that are not so easily alienated. For example, 17 U.S.C.A. §§203(a), 304(c) affords individual authors to cancel any transfer of a copyright interest after a period of three years. 

## Land and Water Rights

In much of the legal framework surrounding natural resources, a “use it or lose it” principle governs. Rather than having an inalienable interest in certain forms of property, an individual may give away her property rights without even intending to do so. Because courts try to promote the most efficient use of natural resources rather than locking them into ownership of any particular entity, courts will recognize a property interest where an individual has made use of the property for long enough that she has established an interest in that property that trumps the original owners property interest. This is the process of “quiet title.”
In Riparian water law, all landowners whose property adjoins a body of water have the right to make “reasonable use” of it as it flows through or over their property. The limits on “reasonable use” are again context dependent: one owner may use a lake for swimming without infringing on the rights of others, but if the same owner wanted to transfer water out of the lake, she would have to compensate the other owners. Equitable compensation for all other owners must be feasible for this to be an option.

## Trust Law
Trust law bypasses alienability concerns by allowing property to exist in the hands of one entity, while still belonging to another entity. In common law legal systems, a trust is a relationship in which property is held by one party for the benefit of another. In a trust setup, the “trustee” holds property for the trust's “beneficiaries.” An owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. The trustee is given legal title to the trust property, but is obligated to act for the good of the beneficiaries. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties. The trustee may be either an individual, a company, or a public body. 

## Intellectual Property Law
Intellectual property law recognizes a particular user’s exclusive rights over content that she has created, often recognized in the form of a copyright. Once an individual user has ownership over her creation, she may license that content to particular users for particular uses. One innovations in the area of Intellectual Property Law—Creative Commons—seeks to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property. Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that gives Creative Commons licenses to creators, which in turn allow those individuals to clearly communicate to others how and for what purposes their creative work may be used.



 
# Personal Rights

Personal rights are considered more fundamental in comparison to property rights. As a result, an individual may not contract away certain personal rights in the same way she may contract away her property rights. Personal rights are reflective of societal norms and consistent among all people. Personal rights derive legitimacy from a sense of universal applicability rather than the power of legislatures and courts.

## Constitutional Rights

Even for fundamental personal rights, there exist scenarios in which these rights come up against other pressing societal interests and must therefore be balanced against those interests. For example, First Amendment protections of free speech are not absolute: an individual’s interest in partaking in protected speech is balanced against the government’s interest in restricting the speech. 

## Universal Rights

Universal rights are similar to domestic constitutional rights, but differ in that they are recognized at a global scale and are based on norms that have been agreed upon at the international rather than just national level. Even within the realm of universal rights, there are disagreements as to whether some rights are more “fundamental” than others. For example, Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights’ ban on slavery is considered a “first generation” right, while the Article 24 right to reasonable working hours falls into the category of a “second generation” right. The different value associated to the preservation of a right shapes international treaties and conduct while also serving as a source of pressure upon individual nation-states to adhere their laws to international norms.      

# Interest-based Rights

One means by which bodies of law grow is organically, through the proliferation of common law among courts.  A more typical model involves a legislative body creating law that is then interpreted and built upon by courts, with periodic checks by legislatures. For issue areas that affect a wide range of actors, a “fourth branch” of government—regulatory agencies—assume primary responsibility for promulgating and enforcing policies. The National Labor Relations Board and Federal Trade Commission are examples. Agency policies and rules are sometimes supplemented by criminal laws, and enforcement is coordinated among agency actors and general law enforcement.
