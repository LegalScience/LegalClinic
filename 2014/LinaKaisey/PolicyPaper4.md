# Introduction

Much has been said about the necessity of a legal framework surrounding Big Data, yet there is no clear introduction for non-lawyers to think about the legal assumptions that will underlie such a framework. This paper fills that gap by giving an overview of analogous areas of law that a lawyer encountering the Wild West of Big Data policy for the first time will draw upon to make sense of it all. With this background, the business and technical actors who interface with lawyers in shaping A Big Data society will understand the background assumptions of their collaborators.

[Cut: This paper fills that gap by laying out the tenets of three sets of legal rights that might serve as the foundation for a right in personal data. First, a property-based conception of rights puts data in the purview of the individual, meaning that an individual may bargain away those rights as she sees fit. Second, a “civil rights”-based conception of rights assumes that the individual’s right to data privacy is too fundamental for society to allow it to be bargained away. Finally, an interests-based notion recognizes that an individual’s interest in their data, while purely individual in theory, has pragmatic effects on society such that society must place its hand in the market that regulates the vindication of the right.]

# Scope of Paper

The framework underlying a Big Data society will include the interaction of Legal, Business, and Technical solutions. This paper does not directly address the Business and Technical facets. Within the legal frameworks underlying Big Data society, there are also multiple actors: common law principles, constitutional norms, regulatory bodies, international treaties, individual enforcement mechanisms, and other such mainstays of legal systems will all play relevant parts. This paper seeks to highlight those elements of legal frameworks that will—and in some cases already have—translated to the realm of issues surrounding the use of personal data.

# Property Rights

A property-based framework of rights assumes that an individual’s interest in her personal data is the same as in any other thing that she may own. Property rights in the legal field are conceived of as a “bundle of rights” – depending on the nature of the property owned and the context of the ownership, an individual may expect a certain mix of rights. So, individuals’ rights in their personal data depend on how we conceive of personal data as property. 

## Contracts of adhesion
It is useful to compare the current state of contract terms to the legal concept of a “contract of adhesion.” Otherwise known as “boilerplate contracts,” these contracts have terms that are determined by the more powerful party and largely or entirely non-negotiable. Examples of contracts of adhesion can include contracts for insurance or for the rental of property. Courts sometimes find such contracts “unconscionable” and therefore unenforceable, when the terms of the boilerplate exceed what a customer may reasonably expect.
Some have argued that the difference between Small Data and Big Data is that the constant gathering of personal data in a Big Data Society renders the gathering of informed consent obsolete.  A fundamental tenet of the New Deal on Data is that individuals must be able to understand the ways in which in their data is used in order to trust those who are using it. 
Even in non-adhesive contracts, a fundamental tenet of commercial and contract law is that parties operate under an “implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”  This amounts to an assumption that both parties will deal with each other honestly and not subvert the others’ reasonable expectations as to how the contract will be carried out. In the Big Data context, the various uses to which a corporation may put an individual’s personal data after it has already been gathered are varied and sometimes difficult to predict at the time the individual hands data over to a company. Personal data gathered for one purpose may be aggregated and combined with information from heterogeneous databases to give rise to an entirely new insight about individual consumers. This leads to the argument that customers should be made aware of how their data may flow through a corporation and be used for new purposes,  so that their expectations upon initially handing over their data are not subverted. 

## Alienability and Inalienability
Property law tends to assume that society is best served when the restrictions on the trade of property are as few as possible. As a result, one of the largest sticks in the bundle of property rights is the right to alienability: the ability for an individual to trade away her interest in property whenever she sees fit, rather than when society allows her to do so. 
This aspect of property rights gives concern to data privacy advocates who believe that it will make it too easy for individuals to give away access to their personal data. However, there are ways to mitigate this concern. The first and simplest is to recognize that courts have recognized that some property rights that are not so easily alienated. For example, 17 U.S.C.A. §§203(a), 304(c) affords individual authors to cancel any transfer of a copyright interest after a period of three years.

## Land and Water Rights

In much of the legal framework surrounding natural resources, a “use it or lose it” principle governs. Rather than having an inalienable interest in certain forms of property, an individual may give away her property rights without even intending to do so. Because courts try to promote the most efficient use of natural resources rather than locking them into ownership of any particular entity, courts will recognize a property interest where an individual has made use of the property for long enough that she has established an interest in that property that trumps the original owners property interest. This is the process of “quiet title.”
In Riparian water law, all landowners whose property adjoins a body of water have the right to make “reasonable use” of it as it flows through or over their property. The limits on “reasonable use” are again context dependent: one owner may use a lake for swimming without infringing on the rights of others, but if the same owner wanted to transfer water out of the lake, she would have to compensate the other owners. Equitable compensation for all other owners must be feasible for this to be an option.
Vast troves of data, and personal data in particular, have frequently been described as “the new oil” to reflect the ubiquity of personal data as well as the unregulated nature of its ownership when first discovered. However, this conception of personal data leaves the new resource up for grabs by corporations and other large entities who have the scale to exploit it. It leaves no room for recognizing the rights of individuals who, put together, are responsible for the creation of the data troves.


## Trust Law, Intellectual Property Law, and OpenPDS
Trust law bypasses alienability concerns by allowing property to exist in the hands of one entity, while still belonging to another entity. In common law legal systems, a trust is a relationship in which property is held by one party for the benefit of another. In a trust setup, the “trustee” holds property for the trust's “beneficiaries.” An owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. The trustee is given legal title to the trust property, but is obligated to act for the good of the beneficiaries. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties. The trustee may be either an individual, a company, or a public body. 
Intellectual property law recognizes a particular user’s exclusive rights over content that she has created, often recognized in the form of a copyright. Once an individual user has ownership over her creation, she may license that content to particular users for particular uses. One innovation in the area of Intellectual Property Law—Creative Commons—seeks to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property. Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that gives Creative Commons licenses to creators, which in turn allow those individuals to clearly communicate to others how and for what purposes their creative work may be used.
The innovation of using OpenPDS to store data reflects facets of both Trust law and the Creative Commons framework in Intellectual Property law. “OpenPDS allows users to collect, store, and give fine-grained access to their data.”  . . .


 
# Personal Rights

Personal rights are considered more fundamental in comparison to property rights. As a result, an individual may not contract away certain personal rights in the same way she may contract away her property rights. Personal rights are reflective of societal norms and consistent among all people. Personal rights derive legitimacy from a sense of universal applicability rather than the power of legislatures and courts.

## Constitutional Rights

	The rights that a nation holds most dear are often articulated in its Constitution. There United States Constitution does not explicitly mention “privacy.” Rather, the “specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.”  The right to privacy is implicitly inferred in the overlapping penumbras created by explicit Constitutional rights.  
Even for fundamental personal rights, there exist scenarios in which these rights come up against other pressing societal interests and must therefore be balanced against those interests. For example, First Amendment protections of free speech are not absolute: an individual’s interest in partaking in protected speech is balanced against the government’s interest in restricting the speech.  
	Depending on the individual right in question and the government interest it runs up against, courts employ varying levels of scrutiny to determine whether to accept or reject the governmental measure. [description of strict scrutiny].
This same balancing occurs in the context of personal data use: absolutist claims about individual data ownership crumble easily when access to data is necessary for government operations. In the constitutional context, the balancing in unforeseeable cases is done by courts. It remains to be seen where this balancing will occur in close questions  pitting individuals’ rights to data privacy against assumptions about how governments may operate. 

## Universal Rights

Universal rights are similar to domestic constitutional rights, but differ in that they are recognized at a global scale and are based on norms that have been agreed upon at the international rather than just national level. Even within the realm of universal rights, there are disagreements as to whether some rights are more “fundamental” than others. For example, Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights’ ban on slavery is considered a “first generation” right, while the Article 24 right to reasonable working hours falls into the category of a “second generation” right.  The different value associated to the preservation of a right shapes international treaties and conduct while also serving as a source of pressure upon individual nation-states to adhere their laws to international norms.  
This will be relevant in determining appropriate treatment of data, where different norms in different areas will result in different assumptions about how personal data should be treated. Poor understanding of different fundamental assumptions results in alienation of the other parties who also have a hand in determining how individuals’ personal data rights will take shape. 
A frequent dichotomy set up in the context of personal data privacy is that between European data privacy norms and American ones. [. . .]. However, treating Europe as a monolith is erroneous.[. . .].

[Cut? # Interest-based Rights

One means by which bodies of law grow is organically, through the proliferation of common law among courts.  A more typical model involves a legislative body creating law that is then interpreted and built upon by courts, with periodic checks by legislatures. For issue areas that affect a wide range of actors, a “fourth branch” of government—regulatory agencies—assume primary responsibility for promulgating and enforcing policies. The National Labor Relations Board and Federal Trade Commission are examples. Agency policies and rules are sometimes supplemented by criminal laws, and enforcement is coordinated among agency actors and general law enforcement.]

# Limits of the Law

Trust is an important part of the framework, and one that no number of laws can entirely secure. Legal instruments and the threat of judicial action are tools available to those who don’t trust their counterparts, and need added assurance where trust cannot bear the full weight of a transaction.

Innovation is also not an element that law is well-suited to bring about. The legal field is, by its nature, backward-looking. A society with good “rule of law” is one in which expectations among actors are met rather than disrupted. Because it relies so much on precedent, lawyers must be fundamentally backward looking and willing to color within the lines—attributes that can be damning to the sorts of creative ideas that will spur “innovate[ions] around user-centricity and trust” that will be fundamental to the New Deal on Data.

“Over time, all stakeholders should hopefully recognise that the collective metric of success is the overall growth of the ecosystem rather than the success of one specific participant.” The basis of legal resolution to disputes is based in an adversarial rather than interests-based system. Even in the context of coordinating contracts, parties forfeit some benefits in order to gain congruent benefits from the other party, not for the good of the contract as a whole.

“The making of data on a massive and aggregated scale raises questions that simply are not answered by the paradigms that have dominated privacy law to date.”
