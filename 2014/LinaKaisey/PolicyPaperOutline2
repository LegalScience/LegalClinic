# Introduction: A spectrum of Rights

Much has been said about the necessity of a legal framework surrounding Big Data, yet there is no clear introduction for non-lawyers to think about the legal assumptions that will underlie such a framework. This paper fills that gap by laying out the tenets of three sets of legal rights that might serve as the foundation for a right in personal data. First, a property-based conception of rights puts data in the purview of the individual, meaning that an individual may bargain away those rights as she sees fit. Second, a “civil rights”-based conception of rights assumes that the individual’s right to data privacy is too fundamental for society to allow it to be bargained away. Finally, a hybrid notion recognizes that an individuals interest in their data, while purely individual in theory, has pragmatic effects on society such that society must place its hand in the market that regulates the vindication of the right.


# Property Rights

A property-based framework of rights assumes that an individual’s interest in her personal data is the same as in any other thing that she may own. Property rights in the legal field are conceived of as a “bundle of rights” – depending on the nature of the property owned and the context of the ownership, an individual may expect a certain mix of rights. So, individuals’ rights in their personal data depend on how we conceive of personal data as property. 
## Alienability and Inalienability
Property law tends to assume that society is best served when the restrictions on the trade of property are as few as possible. As a result, one of the largest sticks in the bundle of property rights is the right to alienability: the ability for an individual to trade away her interest in property whenever she sees fit, rather than when society allows her to do so. This aspect of property rights gives concern to data privacy advocates who believe that it will make it too easy for individuals to give away access to their personal data. However, there are ways to mitigate this concern. The first and simplest is to recognize that courts have recognized that some property rights that are not so easily alienated. For example, 17 U.S.C.A. §§203(a), 304(c) affords individual authors to cancel any transfer of a copyright interest after a period of three years. 

## Land and Water Rights

In much of the legal framework surrounding natural resources, a “use it or lose it” principle governs. Rather than having an inalienable interest in certain forms of property, an individual may give away her property rights without even intending to do so. Because courts try to promote the most efficient use of natural resources rather than locking them into ownership of any particular entity, courts will recognize a property interest where an individual has made use of the property for long enough that she has established an interest in that property that trumps the original owners property interest. This is the process of “quiet title.”
In Riparian water law, all landowners whose property adjoins a body of water have the right to make “reasonable use” of it as it flows through or over their property. The limits on “reasonable use” are again context dependent: one owner may use a lake for swimming without infringing on the rights of others, but if the same owner wanted to transfer water out of the lake, she would have to compensate the other owners. Equitable compensation for all other owners must be feasible for this to be an option.

## Trust Law
Trust law bypasses alienability concerns by allowing property to exist in the hands of one entity, while still belonging to another entity. In common law legal systems, a trust is a relationship in which property is held by one party for the benefit of another. In a trust setup, the “trustee” holds property for the trust's “beneficiaries.” An owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. The trustee is given legal title to the trust property, but is obligated to act for the good of the beneficiaries. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties. The trustee may be either an individual, a company, or a public body.
