* Private right of action - Consumer financial protection and FTC can vindicate right without much cost. 
* State data breach laws and exposure to class action liability are big driver of data laws
* Private sector support for legislation would evaporate if there existed a private right of action
* Where can we forge social consensus around the development of rights? 
* In the absence of legal definition, what's doable as common law on the current background of legal models and analogies
* Overlay policy judgments - the creation of rights by law
* Look at exist models informs how to create a series of legal rights
* Analogies: water rights applies in the wild west of data. prior appropriation. overlayed sectoral regimes in other regimes to define a set of rights
* civil rights: some form of fundamental right. Problem: implied validation of european model. creates tension in US marketplace and roadblock to acceptace. Pragmatic/policy-based is better. How do we avoid the negative misuses of data while enabling the benefits? 
* regulatory
* Trust: trust law, of which public trust company is one form of trust
* Regulatory
* What's the legal significance of investment backed expectations. What's the legal expression of the political reality. 
* To the extent that this is a property right, reasonable investment-backed expectations can create a property interest. This is a legal right! Property interests v. liberty interests at stake. 
* What rights underlay a right to privacy? There's an individual liberty interest at stake, moreso than a property interest. it's about autonomy and expression. Property is coming in because there's an economic interest and policy interest. There's a lot of innovation and social good and investment. Don't want to upset that with political and economic consequences by disrupting existing market expectations. "we're not going to put google out of business."
* ECPA reform: we can't have a rule that gmail has a less protected status than other email. 

* Organizing the piece: Rights framework (civil rights); Property framework (water rights; trust law); Interests-based (regulatory; public interest in the use of the data, as well as individual interests that are at stake -- hybrid) 


* -- this analysis may be less rigorous, but also the best fit with where things are; lots in common with constitutional balancing (constitutional right to free expression, but don't look at first amendment case as saying "Categorically fits into free expression, so that ends the discussion" -- what are the expressional interests at stake; how are they affected; ends means analysis -- what are the public/governmental interests that underly the restriction on free expression -- what's the impact of the restriction or the alternative. Privacy practices and bill of rights -- privacy act implementation. govt agencies are required to do privacy impact analysis as part of their collecting data. OMB circular on privacy act implement. FISMA - information security management act. found its way into privacy practice and what private sector does, and what EU does in its proposed regulation. Bill of rights - privacy risk and respect for context principle. What is the impact on privacy, and balancing that with economic costs and benefits. incorporated in european principle of proportionality: eoncpmpasses data minimization -- how much do you need to collect in order to achieve some objective. in the flixble framework we have, Google generally collects everything. that's part of the service! ok that's in the search services, but streetmap etc doesn't have to collect everyone's unencrypted wifi transmissions (they got in trouble with FTC bc when traveling doing street view, they're also locating wifi hotpots - getting MAC addresses. if it's an insecure hotspot, would collect data)
* Danny weitzner answer to "privacy for sake of privacy" - existing constitutional protections do an adequate job of protecting privacy. abortion and contraception cases base it on individual autonomy. This goes to interest analysis. Justice Douglas and penumbras - we looked at rights more categorically, and didn't analyze interests. penumbras: there are constitutional interests that're touched by privacy. eg 1st amendment 1st and 4th amendment: choice of audience, right to remain silent. Liberty interest and freedom of choice. liberty interests protected by fourth amendment. 
* ^well articulated in President's Review Board Report. Security over persons and papers (preamble). Liberty interests at stake in privacy and protected by fourth amendment. These are diminished if our info is out there. 
* somewhere deal with: why is privacy important? you'll inevitably come back to that. what's the harm we're trying to address. 
* Pew Internet and Society indicates relatively high levels of concern. 
* Prediction of Harm, Latania Sweeney research has shown: if you have other info about a person, it's relatively easy to identify someone in anonymous data. Governor Bill Weld healthcare example. knowing voting records = age gender zip code, he was identified. the more info you have, the more possible that is.
